3. **Backup Saves**:
   - Click "ðŸ’¾ Backup Current Save"

## Configuration

The "Configuration" tab allows you to select which files and folders within the ConanSandbox directory to include in backups:

- Check folders like `Saved/`, `Mods/`, etc.
- Only selected items will be backed up and restored
- This prevents backing up unnecessary files

## Save Management

- **Delete**: Remove unwanted save folders

- **Refresh**: Reload the save list
